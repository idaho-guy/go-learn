#### Notes

app.go
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Hello World")
}

```
There can only be one `main` function in a package

go build to create binary
```
(base) marksage@Marks-MacBook-Pro go-basics % go build
go: cannot find main module, but found .git/config in /Users/marksage/git/idaho-guy/go-learn
        to create a module there, run:
        cd .. && go mod init

        Run 'go help mod init' for more information.
(base) marksage@Marks-MacBook-Pro go-basics % go mod init example.com/first-app
go: creating new go.mod: module example.com/first-app
go: to add module requirements and sums:
        go mod tidy
      
```

Now `go build` will build an executable that runs the program; in order for the binary to be built, a `package main` must exist

```
(base) marksage@Marks-MacBook-Pro go-basics % ./first-app 
Hello World%  
```

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Print("Hello World")
}

#### Basic Types
Go comes with a couple of built-in basic types:

* int => A number WITHOUT decimal places (e.g., -5, 10, 12 etc)
* float64 => A number WITH decimal places (e.g., -5.2, 10.123, 12.9 etc)
* string => A text value (created via double quotes or backticks: "Hello World", `Hi everyone')
* bool => true or false

But there also are some noteworthy "niche" basic types which you'll typically not need that often but which you should still know about:

* uint => An unsigned integer which means a strictly non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 10, 255 etc)
* int32 => A 32-bit signed integer, which is an integer with a specific range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (e.g., -1234567890, 1234567890)
* rune => An alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point (i.e., a single character), and is used when dealing with Unicode characters (e.g., 'a', 'Ã±', 'ä¸–')
* uint32 => A 32-bit unsigned integer, an integer that can represent values from 0 to 4,294,967,295
* int64 => A 64-bit signed integer, an integer that can represent a larger range of values, specifically from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

There also are more types like int8 or uint8 which work in the same way (=> integer with smaller number range)

#### Null Values
All Go value types come with a so-called "null value" which is the value stored in a variable if no other value is explicitly set.

For example, the following int variable would have a default value of 0 (because 0 is the null value of int, int32 etc):

var age int // age is 0
Here's a list of the null values for the different types:

* int => 0
* float64 => 0.0
* string => "" (i.e., an empty string)
* bool => false
